It is one of the most demanding courses in IT industry and that's the major reason why students choose data science. Data Science course is available in hybrid mode which means students can either opt for online or offline batches. The fees for Online batch is 1, 30,000 and the fees for offline batch is 1, 85,000. Length of Data Science course is of 12 months. Total 15 modules are included in Data Science course, modules included in Data Science course are Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and AI. The Data Science Course will include 80% of Practical implementation and 20% Theory Knowledge. Each module of Data Science will have individual projects. Data Scientist and Data Analyst are the job role after completing the data science course. Salary package after the data science course can range from 3LPA to 15LPA.
